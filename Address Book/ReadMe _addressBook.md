If you are willing to edit it or make atomic changes please:
Respect the spaces or indentations; since the project is still under developed. Why not change it any way?

It is a great way to get more used to the python language and the TKinter library.
It is a beginner's project with few explanations. Go to [DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/alarm-clock-python/) for the original source code and some extra explanations.

***Have fun and Happy coding.***

# Address Book -(20-01-2023)

The eighth project I developed is an Address Book that allows the user to add, edit and delete a contact. This project does not make the use of a database as of yet so the contacts are volatile. It is on version 0.1.08 with the size of 3.72 Kb.

> **Utility or why Develop:** This aim of this project was to develop an Address Book using python, and we pretty much did it. This Address Book as all necessary functions operational.

> **Libraries and Prerequisites:** For the Address Book program we only used TKinter. This project was not so complicated to make because currently it does not make the used of a database or registers pictures and emails.
