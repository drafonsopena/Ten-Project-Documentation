If you are willing to edit it or make atomic changes please:
Respect the spaces or indentations; since the project is still under developed, why not change it any way?

It is a great way to get more used to the python language and the TKinter library along with re, requests and API's.
It is a beginner's project with few explanations. Go to DataFlair (https://data-flair.training/blogs/alarm-clock-python/) for the original source code and some extra explanations.

***Have fun and Happy coding.***

# Currency Converter (13-01-2023)

The fifth project I developed is a Currency Converter that can provide the value of all major currencies in the globe (no cripto currencies yet) with the aid of an [API](https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD). This project is quite useful and fun to make, you can feel internationally rich. It is on version 0.1.05 with the size of 5.92 Kb.

> **Utility or why Develop:** This project was developed because before travelling it is a must to know about the customs and what monetary system is being used locally. True we can search with Google of any new AI search engine but why not make and have your own?

> **Libraries and Prerequisites:** For the Currency Converter we used TKinter, re which provides regular expression matching and requests. The exchange rate is done at real time with the help of an [API](https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD).

> **Future Changes:** In a later version I am thinking to add cripto exchange-rate or integrate a calculator to it. Like this we can exchange the currency and make our diner budget within one application.
