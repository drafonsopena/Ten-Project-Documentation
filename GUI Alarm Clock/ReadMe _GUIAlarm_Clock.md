This GUI Alarm Clock was completed 29-12-22 By @drafonsopena.
Using python3.9, Pycharm, Thonny, DataFlair.

If you are willing to edit it or make atomic changes please:
Respect the spaces or indentations; since the project is still under developed. Why not change it any way?

It is a great way to get more used to the python language and the TKinter library along with datatime, time and winsound.
It is a beginner's project with few explanations. Go to [DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/alarm-clock-python/) for the original source code and some extra explanations.

Have fun and Happy coding.

## Note: Make sure to have your libraries installed before starting a new project, this projects are for practising rather than copy and paste. Meaning that the projects are due to change and that typing is hard but very efficient for practising and have the hands on the mud.

  <p>
    
   Check if a certain library is already installed in your machine:
  
    ```
    Eg: pip3 show tk
    ```

# **GUI Alarm Clock v 0.1.0** -(29-12-2022)
The first project I developed is a GUI Alarm clock that can take user input and rings at the desired time but I failed to play put sound and make it ring, we have all necessary features of an alarm clock but we dont have sound. It is on version 0.1.01 with the size of 3.07 Kb.
Utility or why Develop: This project was developed to motivate me to be punctual with my study time, it does not play sound but it sure introduced me to a place where possibilities appear all the time. 

> **Libraries Used:** 
TKinter, datatime, time and windsound.
