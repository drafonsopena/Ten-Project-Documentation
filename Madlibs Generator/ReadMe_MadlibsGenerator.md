If you are willing to edit it or make atomic changes please:
Respect the spaces or indentations; This project works pretty well for my liking but there is room for improvement.
Hopefully it does not generate the same password each time the "Generate Password" button is pressed. Otherwise it would be pointless to make it any way.

It is a great way to get more used to the python language and the TKinter library along with string, random and pyperclip.
It is a beginner's project with few explanations. Go to [DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-password-generator/) for the original source code and some extra explanations.

***Have fun and Happy coding.***

# Mad Libs Generator (09-01-2023)
The third project I developed is a Mad Libs Generator that can take user input and add that input to a story at a random word sequencing, it also allows the user to select one of the three stories. It was hard to understand write all these lines and understand how concatenation works. It is on version 0.1.03 with the size of 4.58 Kb.

> **Utility or why Develop:** This project was developed to keep my password1 strange and safer. This project can be used for security measures and protection.


> **Libraries and Prerequisites:** For this project we only need TKinter.

> **Future Changes:** In a later version I am thinking to add new stories but this time extracted from a PDF file. Maybe make a whole story book based on the Madlibs generated from the app.
