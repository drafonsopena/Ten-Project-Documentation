If you are willing to edit it or make atomic changes please:
Respect the spaces or indentations; This project works pretty well for my liking but there is room for improvement.
Hopefully it does not generate the same password each time the "Generate Password" button is pressed. Otherwise it would be pointless to make it any way.

It is a great way to get more used to the python language and the TKinter library along with string, random and pyperclip.
It is a beginner's project with few explanations. Go to DataFlair (https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-password-generator/) for the original source code and some extra explanations.

Have fun and Happy coding.
