If you are willing to edit it or make atomic changes please:
Respect the spaces or indentations; since the project is still under developed. Why not change it any way?

It is a great way to get more used to the python language and the TKinter library along with base64.
It is a beginner's project with few explanations. Go to [DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/alarm-clock-python/) for the original source code and some extra explanations.

***Have fun and Happy coding.***


The seventh project I developed is a Encode and Decode Message that can encode any English text to random characters, I thought it would be easy but it was not, because the program is only encoding and not decoding. It is on version 0.1.07 with the size of 3.75 Kb.

> **Utility or why Develop:** This program can be used to encode and decode messages using base64 data encoding. The user has to enter a message and choose between encode (e) and decode (d); the same passkey must be used in the encoding and decoding of the message


> **Libraries and Prerequisites:** For the Encode and Decode Message program we used TKinter, and base64 a library used to encode data. This project was complicated to make because currently it does not decode the messages after encoding it nor it recognises the passkey (it basically does nothing if I may say), that aside I still say that it is useful.

  """
    GIT: @drafonsopena
    + The objective is to create a base64 Encode and Decode Message using Python.
    | Group:
    +-+---------------- 1 ----------------
    | Prerequisites:
    | Install libraries (eg: pip3 install tk)
    | Basic Python skills
    | Use a virtual environment
    +---------------- 2 ----------------
    | Project File Structure:
    | Import all the needed libraries/modules
    | Create display window
    | Create labels, functions and buttons
    +---------------- 3 ----------------
    | All necessary libraries for the Encode and Decode Message:
    | import tkinter as tk
    | import base64
    +------------------------------------

**NOTE: It does not decode as of yet.**


> **Future Changes:** This program is mainly being developed to create a chat app and change the encoding level of the messages later on.
