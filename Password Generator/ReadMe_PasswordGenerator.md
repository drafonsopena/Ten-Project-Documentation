If you are willing to edit it or make atomic changes please:
Respect the spaces or indentations; This project works pretty well for my liking but there is room for improvement.
Hopefully it does not generate the same password each time the "Generate Password" button is pressed. Otherwise it would be pointless to make it any way.

It is a great way to get more used to the python language and the TKinter library along with string, random and pyperclip.
It is a beginner's project with few explanations. Go to [DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-password-generator/) for the original source code and some extra explanations.

***Have fun and Happy coding.***

# **Password Generator** -(31-12-2022)
The second project I developed is a Password Generator that can create a random or customized password for the user; to allow the user to copy the generated password with a click; and choose the length of the password. It was hard to understand how to increase the number of characters, currently it goes from eight to thirty two real quick. It is on version 0.1.02 with the size of 2.92 Kb.

> **Utility or why Develop:** This project was developed to keep my ‘password1’ strange and safer. This project can be used for security measures and protection.
  
> **Libraries and Prerequisites:** TKinter, datatime, time and windsound. Make sure to have your libraries installed before starting a new project, this document is *more practical than copy and paste*. Meaning that the projects are due to change and that typing is hard but very efficient for practising and have the hands on the mud. Worry not the source is in the folder GUI Alarm Clock and so on.

  """
    GIT: @drafonsopena
    + The objective of this project is to create a Password Generator using Python.
    | Group:
    +-+---------------- 1 ----------------
    | Prerequisites:
    | Install libraries (eg: pip3 install tk)
    | Basic Python skills
    | Use a virtual environment
    +---------------- 2 ----------------
    | Project File Structure:
    | Import all the needed libraries/modules
    | Create a dialog box for user input
    | Use 'For' loop to combine different characters for the password
    +---------------- 3 ----------------
    | All necessary libraries for the Password Generator:
    | From tkinter import *
    | Import string, random
    | Import pyperclip
    +------------------------------------

> **Future Changes:** In a later version I am thinking to integrate it with the Encode and Decode Message, as in we encode a message but we can only decode/read it if we have the right password. Maybe a bot that helps you encode or decode (translate) morse messages or binary with a password generator. Any other idea on how to use it for other things? If so, please share.
