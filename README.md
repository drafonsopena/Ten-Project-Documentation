This projects were developed using Python 3.9 as the programming language, PyCharm 2022.3.2 (Community Edition) as the main IDE and Thonny as a code tester, because it is simple to use. The version number of each project means: first digit is for the years of existence; second digit is used if any permanent update was made; the third digit is used as the project ID. Please take note that this is not a tutorial.
Developing them felt like *"my back is killing me...aahhh..."* but is was worth it, because I got to do them, now I can share my mistakes, future ideas for them and be proud for aiming at 10, and get the 10 I aimed at.

For no good reason what does Python mean to you?
For me it means that I can do silly things with it, like solving problems and making cool games or write something that does not make sense but runs without an error. I confused about the spaces (indentation), when to use concatenation and a comma, python is fun.
