If you are willing to edit it or make atomic changes please:
Respect the spaces or indentations; since the project is still under developed. Why not change it any way?

It is a great way to get more used to the python language and the TKinter library along with parser, and factorial from the math module.
It is a beginner's project with few explanations. Go to [DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/alarm-clock-python/) for the original source code and some extra explanations.

***Have fun and Happy coding.***

# Simple Calculator -(22-01-2023)

The ninth project I developed is a Simple Calculator that can perform integer and float calculations. It is on version 0.1.09 with the size of 5.29 Kb.

> **Utility or why Develop:** This program can be used to perform mathematical calculations and it outputs the the result of that same calculation. Math can be challenging at times so we need calculators to helps get the answer of difficult equations.

> **Libraries and Prerequisites:** For the Simple Calculator program we used TKinter, parser and factorial from the math module. This project is as the name suggests ‘simple’ but we dont want simple do we?

   """
    GIT: @drafonsopena
    + The objective is to create a Simple Calculator using Python.
    | Group:
    +-+---------------- 1 ----------------
    | Prerequisites:
    | Install libraries (eg: pip3 install tk)
    | Basic Python skills
    | Use a virtual environment
    +---------------- 2 ----------------
    | Project File Structure:
    | Import all the needed libraries/modules
    | Create display window
    | Create labels, functions and buttons
    +---------------- 3 ----------------
    | All necessary libraries for the Simple Calculator:
    | from tkinter import *
    | import parser
    | from math import factorial
    +------------------------------------

> **Future Changes:** Just joking of course we want simple for the end user. This program is mainly being developed to create a Currency Converter Calculator and separately have a calculator that can allow formulas from Physics to calculate speed, force, mass, etc.
