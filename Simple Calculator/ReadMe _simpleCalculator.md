If you are willing to edit it or make atomic changes please:
Respect the spaces or indentations; since the project is still under developed. Why not change it any way?

It is a great way to get more used to the python language and the TKinter library along with parser, and factorial from the math module.
It is a beginner's project with few explanations. Go to [DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/alarm-clock-python/) for the original source code and some extra explanations.

***Have fun and Happy coding.***

# Simple Calculator -(22-01-2023)

The seventh project I developed is a Encode and Decode Message that can encode any English text to random characters, I thought it would be easy but it was not, because the program is only encoding and not decoding. It is on version 0.1.07 with the size of 4.23 Kb.

> **Utility or why Develop:** This program can be used to encode and decode messages using base64 data encoding. The user has to enter a message and choose between encode (e) and decode (d); the same passkey must be used in the encoding and decoding of the message

> **Libraries and Prerequisites:** For the Encode and Decode Message program we used TKinter, and base64 a library used to encode data. This project was complicated to make because currently it does not decode the messages after encoding it nor it recognises the passkey *(it basically does nothing if I may say)*, that aside I still say that it is useful.
