If you are willing to edit it or make atomic changes please:
Respect the spaces or indentations; since the project is still under developed. Why not change it any way?

It is a great way to get more used to the python language and the Turtle library, random along with time.
It is a beginner's project with few explanations. Go to [DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/alarm-clock-python/) for the original source code and some extra explanations.

***Have fun and Happy coding.***



# Snake Game -(24-01-2023)

The tenth project I developed is a Snake Game. It is on version 0.1.10 with the size of 4.68 Kb.

> **Utility or why Develop:** This program helped me to unwind after so many days of typing. The user can play and reminisce about the [Good Ol’Days](https://open.spotify.com/track/20ZP3Om9DvDazXrNUC7WM2?si=6db4105f62e4456a).

> **Libraries and Prerequisites:** For the Snake Game we used Turtle, random and time. This project was fun to do but I forgot to add *“screen.update()”* and spent two days asking myself *“where is the snake and the fruit?”* but overall it was easy and any one can do it.

> **Future Changes:** This program was for fun, cant think of any major changes to this classic. We might only need to change the appearance of the snake and of the fruit, add some extra obstacles and then we’ll see.
